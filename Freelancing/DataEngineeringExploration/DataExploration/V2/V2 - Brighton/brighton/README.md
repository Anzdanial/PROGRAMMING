# Project: Surplus Energy Prediction for Renewable Energy Projects
## Introduction

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating surplus energy in renewable energy projects using historical climatic data. By thoroughly exploring, analyzing, cleaning, and preprocessing the provided datasets, our goal is to create a robust decision-making tool for stakeholders involved in renewable energy initiatives. This document outlines our approach, methodologies, and the assumptions guiding our project. 

### Stage 1: Data Exploration
Objective

The primary objective of this stage is to comprehensively explore, analyze, clean, and preprocess the datasets to make them suitable for subsequent modeling stages.
Tools and Technologies Utilized:

    Programming Language: Python 3.12
    Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Instructions for Executing the Code

    Open the provided Python script in any Python IDE or text editor.
    Replace the placeholder "Dataset File Path" with the actual path to your dataset.
    Run the code in your preferred Python environment.
    Alternatively, you can upload the provided .ipynb file to JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.

Key Assumptions

    Dataset Size: We assume that the dataset for Brighton is manageable in size, enabling comprehensive exploration without requiring data subsets.
    Handling Missing Values: We employ median and mode imputation techniques to address missing values, aiming to preserve the data distribution while filling in gaps.
    Data Splitting: Data splitting for training and testing purposes is not implemented in this stage. Our focus lies on exploratory data analysis rather than modeling.

Surplus Energy Prediction Considerations

    Surplus Energy Threshold: Determining an appropriate surplus energy threshold necessitates a sophisticated model that incorporates various climatic variables and their impact on energy production and consumption.
    Resource Adequacy: While the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) report discusses surplus power within the context of electrical system adequacy, it does not offer specific thresholds based on the variables provided in our dataset.
